# smart-auto-move

smart-auto-move is a Gnome Shell extension which keeps track of all application windows and restores them to the previous position, size, and workspace on restart. Supports Wayland.

## limitations

terminals which include the current directory in the title may not reach the match threshold when restarted if they do not preserve the working directory across restarts.

## behavior

because there is no way to uniquely distinguish individual windows from an application across restarts, smart-auto-move uses a heuristic to uniquely identify them. this is primarily based on startup order and title. in cases where there are multiple windows with the same title, they are restored based on relative startup sequence.

titles are matched using Levenstein distance. the match bonus for title is calculated based on `(title length - distance) / title length`.

## settings

most settings can be modified from the preferences GUI. this section documents all of the dconf values and is only recommended for advanced users.

enable debug logging:

```
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/debug-logging true
```

set the minimum window/title match threshold to 50%:

```
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/match-threshold 0.5
```

set the window synchronization (update/restore) frequency to 50ms:

```
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/sync-frequency 50
```

default to ignoring windows unless explicitly defined. restore all windows of the gnome-calculator app, all firefox windows except for the profile chooser, and Nautilus only if the window title is "Downloads":

```
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/sync-mode "'IGNORE'"
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/overrides '{"gnome-calculator": [{"action":1}], "firefox": [{"query": {"title": "Firefox - Choose User Profile"}, "action": 0}, {"action": 1}],"org.gnome.Nautilus":[{"query":{"title":"Downloads"},"action":1}]}'
```

default to restoring all windows, but ignore the firefox profile chooser and any nautilus windows:

```
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/sync-mode "'RESTORE'"
$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/overrides '{"firefox": [{"query": {"title": "Firefox - Choose User Profile"}, "action": 0}], "org.gnome.Nautilus": [{"action":0}]}'
```

show all saved firefox windows (N.B. `jq` will fail if window title contains `\`):

```
$ dconf read /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/saved-windows | sed "s/^'//; s/'$//" | jq -C .firefox | less -SR
```

there are example configs in the `examples/` dir which can be loaded (N.B. while extension is disabled) with:

```
$ dconf load /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/ < ./examples/default-restore.dconf
```

you can backup your config (restore is the same as above):

```
$ dconf dump /org/gnome/shell/extensions/smart-auto-move/ > smart-auto-move.dconf
```

the gsettings tool can also be used to manipulate these values:

```
$ gsettings --schemadir ./smart-auto-move@khimaros.com/schemas/ set org.gnome.shell.extensions.smart-auto-move sync-mode 'RESTORE'
```

## development

NOTE: this process has only been tested with GNOME running on wayland.

clone this repository and run `make start`.

this will do the following:

- build the extension pack .zip
- install the extension pack
- launch a nested wayland Gnome-Shell session

after the nested instance is running, you will need to enable the extension:

```
$ gnome-extensions enable smart-auto-move@khimaros.com
```

if you make a change to the source code, you will need to exit the session and start a new one.

## publishing

1. update `metadata.json` to latest uploaded version + 1
1. generate the extension zip with `make`
1. upload the zip to extensions.gnome.org
1. repeat as needed if a version is rejected
